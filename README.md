### Installing with Docker

1. Install [docker here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and make sure it's running on your system.

2. Install [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

You can also use `pip`

OR without using a `virtualenv`:
```sh
sudo pip install docker-compose
```
3. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://frankkohlhepp/BAT.git

```
5. (Linux) Run `deploy.sh` with:
```sh
./deploy.sh
```
6. (Optional) In `deploy.sh` comment out line 8 (with `#`) `cp docker/settings.py batproject/batproject/settings.py` to use non deployment settings (eg.: `DEBUG = True`)
